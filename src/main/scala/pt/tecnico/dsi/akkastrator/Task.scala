  * no further processing is necessary. Or `abort` if the received message will prevent subsequent
  * tasks from executing properly.
  *
  * The pattern matching inside `behavior` must invoke `matchId` to ensure the received message
  * is in fact the one that this task its waiting to receive.
  *
  * The internal state of the orchestrator might be mutated inside `behavior`.
  *
  * This class is very tightly coupled with Orchestrator and the reverse is also true. See [[AbstractOrchestrator]] for
