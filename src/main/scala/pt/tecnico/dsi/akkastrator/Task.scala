  * A task corresponds to sending a message to an actor, handling its response and possibly

  * The answer(s) to the sent message must be handled in `behavior`. `behavior` must invoke `finish` when
  * no further processing is necessary. Or `abort` if the received message will prevent subsequent
  * tasks from executing properly.
  *
  * The pattern matching inside `behavior` must invoke `matchId` to ensure the received message
  * is in fact the one that this task its waiting to receive.
  *
  * The internal _state of the orchestrator might be mutated inside `behavior`.
  *
  * This class is very tightly coupled with Orchestrator and the reverse is also true. See [[AbstractOrchestrator]] for
  * more details on why that is the case.

    *    This choice of implementation allows the messages to have a free form, as it is the user that
